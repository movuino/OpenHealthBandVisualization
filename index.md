<h1>Web BLE</h1>

The Web Bluetooth API provides the ability to connect and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals from a web browser.
It is currently only supported by Chrome and Edge. Check the [Browser compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility) for more details.
